# Pet Seizure Tracking Mobile Application

The Pet Seizure Tracking mobile application will be a convenient and powerful tool for pet owners and their veterinarians to communicate, log, and diagnose medical events such as seizure episodes, medication usage, food consumption, sleep, and other symptoms the pet may display.
The application will motivate owners to actively keep up with tracking their petâ€™s activity using a simple and efficient interface to submit new logged events through a streamlined form system. The data sent by the pet owners will then be compiled and packaged into a digestible and statistic-oriented package that can be accessed by their veterinarians either directly through the app or externally.
